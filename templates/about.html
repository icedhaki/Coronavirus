        <br> “When there was a surge in COVID-19 cases in our hospital, we saw more and more donations coming into the hospital. With these donations, we were able to have enough medical equipment for ourselves and even help other hospitals nearby who were low on resources. Thank you to all our donors for this outpouring of support!”
